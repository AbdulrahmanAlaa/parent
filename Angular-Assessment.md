# App Coding Task

The goal of this task is to check your knowledge, speed, code quality, UI background and testing techniques.

## Requirements

Create a simple web application that consumes a RESTful web service (<https://reqres.in/>) through the following endpoints:

- An API endpoint for logging in and authentication. (Login view)
- An API endpoint for listing users. (Users list view)
- An API endpoint for getting a single user. (Single user view)
- An API endpoint for creating a user. (User creation view)
- An API endpoint for deleting a user. (User removal modal)
- An API endpoint for updating a user. (User updating view)

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The web app should use a good user interface using bootstrap.
- Jasmine testing framework should be used to assert that all of the noted endpoints are running as expected.
- Use Angular Toastr to show success message when creating, deleting, or updating a user. (<https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr>)

### While building this web app:

- use GIT and commit as often as possible using descriptive descriptions.
- Communicate with any questions needed.
- Keep in mind that the Create/Update/Delete operations won't store any of the data in the 3rd party's database, but the responses can be tested.

_Happy coding!_
